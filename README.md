Contact Tracing System

This system is for contact tracing purposes built based on my Daily Health Questionaire System using laravel, now this system is basic PHP OOP
all of the system function will be coded on PHP for the notification maybe will add Javascript in order to have a real life notification just like the DHSQ.
